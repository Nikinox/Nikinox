This repository contains all my programming projects.
All the projects are currently in the root of the repository, but I'm working on to organize all of them so every project has its own README.
Tentativo calcolatrice 1 and Tentativo calcolatrice 2 - they were both tries to build my own calculator app but the only thing I achieved to build is a GUI with buttons;
cifratore di messaggi - a tool to encrypt and decrypt text with the encryption a->b and the reverse encryption b->a;
White noise generator - a tool to create locally white noise;
ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR - the classic game of rock paper and scissor;
prank - a script that opens up a window that generates random numbers to make it seems like you've been hacked;
Spirografo - a script that shows a draw when you run it;
Tris - a try to make a tictactoe, in the future I hope to insert a ML player to play againist;
