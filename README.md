I'm Nikinox.
I'm a teenager and I like very much programming.
I'm working on creating as many things as possible to earn as much experience as possible.
I use python 3.8 IDLE for running my python code, codeskulptor https://py3.codeskulptor.org/ for quick tests without saving a bunch of prototypes on my pc, mycompiler https://www.mycompiler.io/it for the running other languages files and notepad++ to edit them.
