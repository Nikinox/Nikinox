Intro

This is the classic game where you choose one between rock, paper and scissorr and you see if you won, lose or tie againist CPU.

Technologies

Python the python library random.

Features

You tell it if you want to play and until you input a valid answer he will ask you to insert an answer.
Then he will do the same with your move.
He will compare your choice with his output.
Finally he will ask you if you want to play again doing the same thing of the beginning and until your answer is 1(= yes) the program won't stop.

The process

I saw it on a github repository and I tried to rewrite it.

What I learned

I learned about loops and how to make better error checking conditions.

What could be improved

There could be also more objects so it isn't the classic game but a personalyzed version.
