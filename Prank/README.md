Intro

This is a script that when runned it opens a window and spams random numbers to make it seem like you got hacked.

Technologies

Python the python library random and tkinter

Features

You just run it.

The process

I saw it on a video and I tried to replicate it, but it was in batch so I rewrote it with some help and I achieved creating that script in python.

What I learned

I learned about tkinter, how to create windows, and how to use them to display something with cycles.

What could be improved

There could be also the possibility to spam also letters and symbols and not just numbers.
